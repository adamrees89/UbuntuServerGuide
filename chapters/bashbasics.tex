\section{Bash Scripts}
\label{ssec:bash}

These scripts are really simple to set up, simply open a blank file and type the following;

\begin{lstlisting}
#!/bin/bash

[Your set of commands here]
\end{lstlisting}

Now set the file to executable by running the command below to change permissions;

\begin{lstlisting}
sudo chmod +x [FILE NAME]
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Output}

The messages from a custom script can be output to the to a system log (syslog) using;

\begin{lstlisting}
logger
\end{lstlisting}

Usage is simple, to write a line to the $syslog$ file we use;

\begin{lstlisting}
logger A Message
\end{lstlisting}

There are other options use;

\begin{lstlisting}
man logger
\end{lstlisting}

to see them.



\chapter{Window Control with Bash}

In appendix~\ref{app:wmctrl} an example of a bash script that can manipulate the positioning of a window can be seen.  This example opens a file every five minutes in the same place every time.

In order to use this script or any of the techniques for setting the window size/position a piece of software called wmctrl is required, run the following as root:

\begin{lstlisting}
apt-get install wmctrl
\end{lstlisting}
